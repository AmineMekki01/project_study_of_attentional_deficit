# project_study_of_attentional_deficit
Study of attentional deficit using EEG signals.

This is a school project for the course of Human and machine at Ecole des Mines.

The objective is to classify the epochs according to the class Hit or NoHit. 

I decided to make it in a modular way. But as a deliverable, I will provide a notebook with the whole process as well.

I added a small web app to train (It doesn't take too much time) and test the model.

I added some plots and tables to visualize the data and the results. But i will add full detailed analysis in the notebook. And maybe in the web app as well.

## How to run the web app

1. Clone the repo
2. It is better to create a virtual environment for this project using conda. conda create --name stroke_project python=3.10
3. Install the requirements using "pip install -r requirements.txt" int the project directory.
4. Run the flask app using : "python app.py"
5. Open your browser and go to the following url if nothing shows up: http://127.0.0.1:5000/ 
6. You can now train the model and test it.


## How to run the notebook
I will add the notebook soon.
